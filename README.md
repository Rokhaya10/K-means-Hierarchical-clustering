# K-means-Hierarchical-clustering
Objective
K-means & Hierarchical clustering 
This case requires developing a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit cardholders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Following is the Data Dictionary for Credit Card dataset :

1. Load your dataset. 

2. Use hierarchical clustering to identify the inherent groupings within your data.

3. Plot the clusters. 

4. Plot the dendrogram. Use k-means clustering. 

5. Try different k values and select the best one. 

6. Plot the clusters. 

7. Compare the two results. 

Bonus: search for another validation metric
